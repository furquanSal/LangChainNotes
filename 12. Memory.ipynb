    "(d) - `ConversationalRetrievalChain`: This chain is used to maintain a conversational context across multiple turns of a conversation. It uses a vector store to retrieve relevant documents based on the current question, as well as the previous questions and answers in the conversation. This chain is useful for building conversational agents that can handle complex, multi-turn conversations."
