    "A Transform chain in LangChain is a type of chain that applies a custom function to the input or output of a language model. A Transform chain can be used to pre-process, post-process, or modify the text in various ways, such as trimming spaces, extracting entities, or formatting responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Transform chain requires the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `input_variables` : a list of keys expected by the transform function’s input dictionary.\n",
    "- `output_variables` : a list of keys returned by the transform function’s output dictionary.\n",
    "- `transform` : the transform function itself, which takes a dictionary as input and returns a dictionary as output."
